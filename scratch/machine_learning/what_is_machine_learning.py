# Everyone has her own exact definition, but we'll use machine learning to refer 
# to creating and using models that are learned from data. In other contexts this 
# might be called predictive modeling or data mining, but we will stick with 
# machine learning. Typically, our goal will be to use existing data to develop 
# models that we can use to predict various outcomes for new data, such as:

#   * Whether an email message is spam or not
#   * Whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent
#   * Which advertisement a shopper is most likely to click on
#   * Which football team is going to win the Super Bowl

# Now, in even the simplest situation there are entire universes of models that 
# might describe the relationship we're interested in. In most cases we will 
# ourselves choose a parameterized of models and then use data to learn parameters 
# that are in some way optimal.
